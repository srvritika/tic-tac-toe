# tic-tac-toe
This is my first JavaScript project, where I recreate the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to get hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic using vanilla JavaScript.

The Tic Tac Toe game supports a two-player mode, allowing players to take turns as Player X and Player O with clear, turn-based visual feedback. It includes automatic win detection for all possible winning combinations—rows, columns, and diagonals—and highlights the winning line when a player wins. The game also handles draw situations by recognizing when all cells are filled with no winner. Additionally, a reset feature is provided to easily restart the game without refreshing the page, ensuring a smooth and replayable experience.

What I Learned:
* Manipulating the DOM dynamically using querySelector and addEventListener
* Using arrays to track game state and determine the winner
* Applying CSS to create an interactive grid-based UI
* Writing clear conditional logic for win/draw scenarios
* Debugging using console.log() and browser dev tools.

Tech Stack used:
* HTML – for layout
* CSS – for styling the board and hover effects
* JavaScript – for game logic and interaction
